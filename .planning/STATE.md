# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-15)

**Core value:** Upload a contract, walk away with a complete breakdown -- risks, scope, dates, compliance -- with exact contract language quoted so you can act immediately.
**Current focus:** v1.5 Code Health -- Phase 27 Foundation Utilities

## Current Position

Phase: 27 of 31 (Foundation Utilities) -- first of 5 phases in v1.5
Plan: 1 of 2 in current phase
Status: Executing
Last activity: 2026-03-15 -- Completed 27-01 Foundation Utilities plan

## Performance Metrics

**v1.0 (Phases 1-6):** 13 plans, ~45 min/plan avg
**v1.1 (Phases 7-10):** 8 plans, ~4.25 min/plan avg
**v1.2 (Phases 11-14):** 5 plans, single session (parallel waves)
**v1.3 (Phases 15-21):** 8 plans, single session
**v1.4 (Phases 22-26):** 11 plans, 2 days

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full decision log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table (37 decisions).
Recent decisions affecting v1.5:

- Incremental extraction over wholesale rewrite -- safer without test coverage
- No new runtime dependencies -- all refactoring uses existing stack
- Server modularization last -- highest regression risk, verify client phases first
- [Phase 27]: StorageResult<T> wrapper with ok/data/error/quotaExceeded for all storage operations
- [Phase 27]: Kept CompanyProfileSchema in api/analyze.ts nested inside AnalyzeRequestSchema

### Pending Todos

None.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Tailwind JIT purge risk: severity palette map must use complete class strings, not fragments
- Zod/TS reconciliation requires localStorage migration for existing contracts
- Vercel `export const config` must stay in api/analyze.ts entry file during modularization
- Human UAT (live API + real contract) not yet performed (carried forward)
- vercel.json maxDuration: 300 may require Vercel Pro plan (carried forward)
